Abstractâ€”This study investigates the efficiency of transfer learning models in predicting 5 categories of common
skin diseases Acne and Rosacea, vitiligo, Tinea Ringworm
Candidiasis and other Fungal Infections, Melanoma Skin
Cancer Nevi and Moles, and Eczema. Addressing common
skin conditions holds significant public health implications,
as they contribute to healthcare costs and resource allocation. Common skin conditions such as acne, rosacea,
vitiligo, fungal infections, moles, and eczema can occur
due to various factors, including genetics, environmental
influences, lifestyle factors, and immune system responses.
Two transfer learning models InceptionV3 and EfficentNet
are used to classify the images. In the results analysis,
InceptionV3 outperformed the EfficientNet model. The
inceptionV3 model achieved 90 percent accuracy whereas
EfficientNet achieved poor accuracy at 40 percent. The experimental analysis is conducted on two datasets available
on Kaggle Dermnet and skinned.
